# Kickstat

A simple tool for managing your soccer teams. One place to log match stats, manage rosters, and keep track of who's paid up.

## What This Is

We play on multiple indoor soccer teams and wanted a central spot to track everything after games.

## What We Track

- **Match Results** — scores, dates, opponents
- **Player Stats** — goals, assists, yellow cards, red cards
- **Rosters** — who's on which team, active/inactive status
- **Payments** — who has paid for the season/session and who still owes

## Project Structure

## Getting Started

_Coming soon — we're still deciding on the format and tooling (spreadsheets, JSON, a simple web app, etc.)._
